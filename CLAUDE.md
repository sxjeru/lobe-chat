# CLAUDE.md

Guidelines for using Claude Code in this LobeChat repository.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16 + React 19 + TypeScript
- SPA inside Next.js with `react-router-dom`
- `@lobehub/ui`, antd for components; antd-style for CSS-in-JS
- react-i18next for i18n; zustand for state management
- SWR for data fetching; TRPC for type-safe backend
- Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL; Vitest for testing

## SPA Routes and Features

SPA-related code is grouped under `src/spa/` (entries + router) and `src/routes/` (page segments). We use a **roots vs features** split: route trees only hold page segments; business logic and UI live in features.

- **`src/spa/`** – SPA entry points (`entry.web.tsx`, `entry.mobile.tsx`, `entry.desktop.tsx`) and React Router config (`router/`). Keeps router config next to entries to avoid confusion with `src/routes/`.

- **`src/routes/` (roots)**\
  Only page-segment files: `_layout/index.tsx`, `index.tsx` (or `page.tsx`), and dynamic segments like `[id]/index.tsx`. Keep these **thin**: they should only import from `@/features/*` and compose layout/page, with no business logic or heavy UI.

- **`src/features/`**\
  Business components by **domain** (e.g. `Pages`, `PageEditor`, `Home`). Put layout chunks (sidebar, header, body), hooks, and domain-specific UI here. Each feature exposes an `index.ts` (or `index.tsx`) with clear exports.

When adding or changing SPA routes:

1. In `src/routes/`, add only the route segment files (layout + page) that delegate to features.
2. Implement layout and page content under `src/features/<Domain>/` and export from there.
3. In route files, use `import { X } from '@/features/<Domain>'` (or `import Y from '@/features/<Domain>/...'`). Do not add new `features/` folders inside `src/routes/`.

See the **spa-routes** skill (`.agents/skills/spa-routes/SKILL.md`) for the full convention and file-division rules.

## Development

### Starting the Dev Environment

```bash
# SPA dev mode (frontend only, proxies API to localhost:3010)
bun run dev:spa

# Full-stack dev (Next.js + Vite SPA concurrently)
bun run dev
```

After `dev:spa` starts, the terminal prints a **Debug Proxy** URL:

```
Debug Proxy: https://app.lobehub.com/_dangerous_local_dev_proxy?debug-host=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A9876
```

Open this URL to develop locally against the production backend (app.lobehub.com). The proxy page loads your local Vite dev server's SPA into the online environment, enabling HMR with real server config.

### Git Workflow

- **Branch strategy**: `canary` is the development branch (cloud production); `main` is the release branch (periodically cherry-picks from canary)
- New branches should be created from `canary`; PRs should target `canary`
- Use rebase for `git pull`
- Commit messages: prefix with gitmoji
- Branch format: `<type>/<feature-name>`
- PR titles with `✨ feat/` or `🐛 fix` trigger releases

### Package Management

- `pnpm` for dependency management
- `bun` to run npm scripts
- `bunx` for executable npm packages

### Testing

```bash
# Run specific test (NEVER run `bun run test` - takes ~10 minutes)
bunx vitest run --silent='passed-only' '[file-path]'

# Database package
cd packages/database && bunx vitest run --silent='passed-only' '[file]'
```

- Prefer `vi.spyOn` over `vi.mock`
- Tests must pass type check: `bun run type-check`
- After 2 failed fix attempts, stop and ask for help

### i18n

- Add keys to `src/locales/default/namespace.ts`
- For dev preview: translate `locales/zh-CN/` and `locales/en-US/`
- Don't run `pnpm i18n` - CI handles it

## Linear Issue Management

**Trigger conditions** - when ANY of these occur, apply Linear workflow:

- User mentions issue ID like `LOBE-XXX`
- User says "linear", "link linear", "linear issue"
- Creating PR that references a Linear issue

**Workflow:**

1. Use `ToolSearch` to confirm `linear-server` MCP exists (search `linear` or `mcp__linear-server__`)
2. If found, read `.agents/skills/linear/SKILL.md` and follow the workflow
3. If not found, skip Linear integration (treat as not installed)

## Skills (Auto-loaded by Claude)
